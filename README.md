# MONet-Replication
MONet-Replication is a faithful PyTorch reimplementation of MONet (Burgess et al., 2019), following the original architecture, mathematical formulation, and compositional generative model. The project focuses on reproducing the recursive attention mechanism, component-wise VAEs, and full ELBO objective for theoretical understanding.
